## ‚ú® Key Features & Techniques

- **Bag of Words (BoW)**
	- Simple yet powerful text representation.
	- Used in: `Feature Extraction(Bag of Words).ipynb`, `Duplicate Question Pairs/Basic EDA with BOW.ipynb`

- **N-grams**
	- Captures context and word order.
	- Used in: `Feature Extraction(N-grams).ipynb`

- **TF-IDF**
	- Highlights important words in documents.
	- Used in: `Feature Extraction(TF-IDF).ipynb`, `Text Classification (ML Approach)/Text Classification (BOW & TF-IDF).ipynb`

- **POS Tagging**
	- Part-of-speech tagging with spaCy.
	- Used in: `POS Tagging.ipynb`

- **Text Classification**
	- Machine learning models for sentiment analysis and more.
	- Used in: `Text Classification (ML Approach)/Text Classification (BOW & TF-IDF).ipynb`, `Text Classification (ML Approach)/Text Classification (Word2Vec).ipynb`

- **Word2Vec Embeddings**
	- Semantic vector representations of words.
	- Used in: `Word2Vec (Game of Thrones)/Game of Thrones (Word2Vec).ipynb`, `Text Classification (ML Approach)/Text Classification (Word2Vec).ipynb`

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
	- Visualizations and feature engineering.
